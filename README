This project is intented to build ffmpeg based player for Android.

- Building ffmpeg for Android
 -
Make sure that you have environment variable ANDROID_HOME pointing to Android SDK, and NDK pointing to Android Native SDK.
Then add them on your system path so you can work comfortably. Add the following line to ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile, depending on your system

Specify here location of Android Native SDK
# export NDK="$HOME/ndk-android"   

# export $NDK:$ANDROID_HOME/tools:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools:$PATH

Now get the source code

# git clone git@github.com:mikebevz/AFPlayer.git
# cd AFPlayer
# android update project -p . -s
# cd jni
# ./download.sh

After this wait until ffmpeg is downloaded and built. If everything is okay, then continue. Otherwise submit your errors to Issues.

# cd ..
# ant clean debug install 
This will build and install the program on the connected android phone.
See the source code for examples on how to use ffmpeg from Java code. (It's not that much to see yet though)
